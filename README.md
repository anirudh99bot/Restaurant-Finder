# Restaurant-Finder
a command line application which takes in the current location of the user (City name) and gets the exact coordinates for the city name defined. Then use the Zomato API to find out a restaurant in that city ( picked dynamically not hard coded), and then find out the cab fare prices between your current location and the restaurant location, and display it on the screen.
